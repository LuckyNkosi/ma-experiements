# The Usability of Cross-device Controllers

Welcome to the repository for "The Usability of Cross-device Controllers" study, conducted by Lucky Nkosi, a student at Wits University. This research project investigates the reusability and usability of controllers across multiple devices by measuring the impact that different controller schemes have on the HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) experience.

This repository contains the software and data used in the study, which is made available to the public for further research and exploration.

## Overview

The goal of this study is to explore how effectively controllers designed for one device can be reused with other devices. By studying various types of controllers and devices, the research aims to provide insights into the design and compatibility considerations for creating cross-device controllers.

Three types of controllers were used in the study: a keyboard, a gamepad, and a custom-built controller.

## Repository Structure

- `/docs`: Contains the static files served by the Node.js express server.
- `/data`: Includes anonymized data collected during the study. This data is provided in spreadsheet format for further analysis.
- `index.js`: Node.js server script to serve the static files in the `/public` directory and expose the project's API.

## Software Interaction

The static (front-end) portion of the study is made available through Github Pages and can be accessed at the following URL: [https://lucky-nkosi.github.io/cross-device-controllers/](https://lucky-nkosi.github.io/cross-device-controllers/).

## Getting Started
